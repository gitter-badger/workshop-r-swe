...

## Where to start

1. Fork the repository https://github.com/kkmann/simulatr to your github account
2. Add collaborators to the repository!
2. Clone the repository into your working environment (RStudio & git need to be installed). Otherwise, you can click on the "launch binder" badge or [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kkmann/workshop-r-swe/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio) to open a (free) RStudio instance in the cloud. This instance is transient and will close after 10 minutes of inactivity. No data are saved between sessions.
3. Create a branch
4. Make some changes 
5. Commit the changes to your branch
6. Push your branch to your fork of the repository (requires a github personal access token)
8. Open a pull request and wait for the checks to run through (careful, the badges in your fork need to be adjusted to the new repo url to work properly)
9. Have a collaborator review the code and approve the pull request
10. Merge back into main
10. Celebrate and check out the updated documentation after a few minutes
